Food Desert Analysis Project

Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors contributing to food deserts using the USDA Food Access Research Atlas Data from 2019. The analysis employs a Random Forest model to identify key predictors and understand their importance in determining food deserts.

Objectives

To identify the key factors contributing to the presence of food deserts.
To predict food desert status at the census tract level using a Random Forest model.
To analyze and interpret the importance of various socioeconomic and demographic features.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the USDA Food Access Research Atlas Data from 2019, which includes:

Information on the availability of supermarkets and grocery stores.
Socioeconomic indicators such as poverty rate, median household income, and vehicle ownership.
